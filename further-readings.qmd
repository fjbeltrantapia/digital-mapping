For a more detailed discussion on how historians use GIS tools, see @gregory2007, @knowles2008, @marti2011, @gregory2014, @gregory2018; @lawson2021, @travis2020, @cole2022, @mogorovich2022 and @mcdonough2024. See also @presner2015 for a discussion on the geospatial turn in the humanities in general. Spatial history nonetheless comes in a variety of forms, not necessarily involving using GIS tools [@bavaj2022b]. Maps actually constitute another historical *source*, so they contain useful information that helps knowing more about the past. In this regard, historians of maps and mapping practices often study maps as cultural objects [@mcdonough2024, p. 99]. @schulten2012 and @spychal2024, for instance, trace the growing use of maps in the US and UK during the 19^th^ century as tools for shaping history, policy and national identity.
