title: "Case-study 3: Literacy in 19th-century Spain"
---

This case-study relies on the report published by authorities that summarised the information collected in the [1860 Spanish Population Census](https://www.ine.es/inebaseweb/treeNavigation.do?tn=192209). In particular, it focuses on the number of men and women living in each Spanish district (*partido judicial*) classified according to whether they were illiterate, able to read or able to read and write.

1860 Population Census. Summary by districts (province of Zaragoza).

As the figure above illustrates, this source presents mostly numerical information, neatly structured in rows and columns, that can be easily transferred to a digital version. The sources contains information on the number of municipalities and households in each district, how many household  (or the number the total number of men and wom

This is a very simple file reporting the number of individuals 



Inputing the raw data into an Excel spreadsheet results in @fig-excel below. Each column, known as **field** or **variable** presents a piece of information. As well as the case number (*casen*) and the date of admission (information that is split in two fields: *month* and *year*), the source records several pieces of information about these inmates, such *name* and *surname*, *sex*, *age*, place of birth (*born*) and country of birth (*countryb*), the place where the were living before being imprisoned (*reside*), height (in *feet* and *inches*) and *weight*, occupation (*occup*) and whether they were *employed* or not. It also reports their *literacy*, the *marks* that were visible in their bodies, the *offence* they committed and the *sentence* they received. While the first row displays the name of these variables, the remaining rows are devoted to each individual in the dataset.

Who were these prisoners? Where they were coming from? Did prisoners' occupations differ significantly from the rest of the population? What about literacy rates? Did men and women commit different crimes? Did judges treat everyone equally or did particular groups suffer harsher sentences? What explains the variation in stature and weights observed across prisoners? How did theses dimensions change during the period? The range of historical questions that this source can address is almost endless. Sarah Horrell, David Meredith and Deborah Oxley have relied on this information to significantly contribute to our understanding of 19th-century British society, especially regarding the biological living standards of the working classes and the gender dynamics that drove the allocation of resources within these families \[@horrell2013; @meredith2015).[^1_1_desc_cat-2] We strongly encourage reading those pieces to get to know more about the source and its possibilities. Bear in mind that, for practical reasons, we will rely on a subset of the full data set, containing a thousand prisoners.[^1_1_desc_cat-3]

[^1_1_desc_cat-2]: In a seminal paper, Sarah Horrell and Deborah Oxley had previously addressed these issues using similar registers from the Wandsworth prison, near London [@horrell2009].

[^1_1_desc_cat-3]: We are extremely grateful to Deborah Oxley and Hamish Maxwell-Stewart for kindly sharing the Paisley dataset.

This type of source allows exploring many historical questions: 

- How did the biological living standard of living change during the period? 

- What explains the variation in stature observed across prisoners? 

- Did prisoners' occupations differ significantly from the rest of the population? 

- What about literacy rates? 

- Did men and women commit different crimes? 

- Did judges treat everyone equally or did particular groups suffer harsher sentences?
